To train and deploy cash forecasting model for one of the leading chain shops here in Australia.

The process was pretty much as follows:
1.Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather historical financial data (sales, expenses, inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, etc.).Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values and normalizing.

2.Feature Engineering:
Create features such as Sales Growth, Expenses Growth, Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, and Payables Turnover.
Shift the target variable (Cash Flow) to create a forecasting scenario.

3.Train-Test Split:
Split the data into training and testing sets.

4.Model Selection and Training:
Select a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM).

5.Fit the model to the training data.
Model Evaluation

6.Predict on the test set.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

7.Forecasting Future Cash Flows:
Use the trained model to predict future cash flows based on future features.

I used python numpy, pandas, sklearn for this process.
